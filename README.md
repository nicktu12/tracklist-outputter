# Tracklist Outputter

## The problem:
As a DJ, I like to share on social media a list of tracks I've played. While sharing this list as text is perfectly functional, I wanted to create a program to make animated tracklists. 

## Solution:
I used chatgpt to write a simple ruby program that animates the background of a tracklist.
